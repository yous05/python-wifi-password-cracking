# python-wifi-password-cracking
Want to create python script which might give you access to your surroundings wifi network?
i have used pywifi python library to make a script which will try to connect to available wifi network. what we need to do ?

Step - 1 : Discovery Of Network
Step - 2 : Information Gathering (Not Social Engineering)
Step - 3 : Enter into Network

we will first find the networks around us (like how many access points are available ) then we will have one file which contain top - 1000 predictable password. we will try to apply passwords to each network one by one.
